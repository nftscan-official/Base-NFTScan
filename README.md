Through Base NFTScan, users can search and query any wallet address to obtain the NFT data and historical records held by them; users can also search for an NFT contract address or NFT Collection name to view the NFT project and the asset details of each NFT item . In addition, Base NFTScan will also analyze the traded data of NFT Marketplace and NFTfi data on the Base network, as well as other NFT data analysis functions.

### Development Process:
1. We need to run the full node server of the Base network;

3. We analyze the NFT data and interaction records of the Base network according to the NFT asset protocol standard (ERC721 and ERC1155), and synchronize them to the database;

5. We will standardize the parsed NFT data, and then provide Base NFT data services externally through openapi;

7. The Base NFTScan browser is the first product developed based on Base NFT data.

#### To build Web3 products using the NFTScan NFT API service, we can sign up for the NFTScan developer platform.
